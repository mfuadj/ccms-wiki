## Initial Assessment

### Laboratory Tests
- **HbA1c** - Primary glycemic control marker
- **Fasting glucose** - Initial diagnostic assessment
- **Random glucose** - If symptomatic presentation
- **Lipid profile** - Cardiovascular risk assessment
- **Kidney function** - eGFR and ACR for nephropathy screening

### Clinical Assessment
- **Blood pressure** measurement (multiple readings)
- **BMI calculation** and waist circumference
- **Diabetic complications** screening (feet, eyes, kidneys)
- **Medication review** and adherence assessment

---

## Treatment Goals

### Glycemic Control
- **HbA1c target**: < 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most adults
- **Individualized targets** for elderly patients (< 8%)
- **Preprandial glucose**: 4.0-7.0 mmol/L
- **Postprandial glucose**: < 10.0 mmol/L

### Cardiovascular Risk Management
- **Blood pressure**: < 140/90 mmHg (< 130/80 if high CVD risk)
- **LDL cholesterol**: < 2.6 mmol/L (< 1.8 if very high risk)
- **Smoking cessation** if applicable
- **Weight management** (5-10% reduction if overweight)

---

## Medication Protocol

### First Line Treatment
- **Metformin**: Starting dose 500mg twice daily with meals
- **Contraindications**: eGFR < 30, acute heart failure
- **Titration**: Increase by 500mg weekly to maximum 2550mg daily
- **Monitoring**: eGFR every 6-12 months

### Second Line Options
Add one of the following to metformin:

1. **Sulfonylureas** (Gliclazide MR)
   - Starting dose: 30mg daily
   - Maximum: 120mg daily
   - Monitor for hypoglycemia

2. **DPP-4 inhibitors** (Sitagliptin)
   - Dose: 100mg daily (adjust for kidney function)
   - Weight neutral, low hypoglycemia risk

3. **SGLT-2 inhibitors** (if eGFR â‰¥45)
   - Cardiovascular and renal benefits
   - Monitor for UTIs and DKA

## Follow-up Schedule

### 3 Months (Initial)
- **HbA1c** measurement and medication adjustment
- **Blood pressure** and weight monitoring
- **Side effects** assessment and medication tolerance
- **Lifestyle** counseling reinforcement

### 6 Months (Comprehensive Review)
- **Full clinical assessment** including complications screening
- **Laboratory monitoring** - HbA1c, lipids, kidney function
- **Medication optimization** based on targets achieved
- **Referral** consideration if targets not met

### 12 Months (Annual Review)
- **Comprehensive complications** screening
- **Diabetic eye** examination (fundoscopy/photography)
- **Foot assessment** and care planning
- **Cardiovascular risk** reassessment

---

## Patient Education

### Key Topics
- **Blood glucose monitoring** techniques and interpretation
- **Medication adherence** and timing
- **Hypoglycemia** recognition and management
- **Sick day rules** and medication adjustments
- **Lifestyle modifications** - diet and exercise

### Resources
- **Diabetes educator** referral for complex cases
- **Dietitian** consultation for nutritional counseling
- **Patient information** leaflets and resources
- **Support groups** and diabetes organizations

---

## Red Flags - Immediate Action Required

- **HbA1c > 9%** despite optimal therapy
- **Recurrent severe hypoglycemia**
- **Signs of diabetic complications** (retinopathy, nephropathy)
- **Acute illness** with poor glycemic control
- **Patient unable to self-manage** diabetes care
